# Choco Config
This is my choco config file. So I can keep track of the programs, and versions I have installed. 

In the event of a reinstall, or new machine do the following:

1. Install chocolatly on the new machine
2. Pull down the config file
3. Run `choco install choco_config.config`
4. Profit
